# Buildstreet
This repo contains the [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) compose scripts for the entire build environment of [OwnTournament.org](https://owntournament.org).

This includes [Jenkins](https://jenkins.owntournament.org/), [Nexus](https://nexus.owntournament.org/) and [Sonarqube](https://sonar.owntournament.org/).
It also contains [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io/), a Docker container management tool. This tool is exposed on the OwnTournament.org-website, but it can only be accessed by a few people.

The build environment is still under construction and may not be fully accessible at this moment.
